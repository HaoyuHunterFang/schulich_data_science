    "The results show that whether both Variant A or Varient B have higher mean values for CTR and Time Spent compared to the Control group. It is concluded their negative T-statistic values. Additionally, All p-values are smaller than 0.05, so both Varient A and B have statistically significant difference for CTR and Time spent. \n",
    "Based on the values of T-statistic, we can see that Control Group and Variant A have smaller number, so the performance of Variant A are more higher than Variant B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the other factors are not considered, the enginnering team can focus on developing Varient A and B; at the same time, they need to analyze in real-time to ensure the reliability of the results. Therefore, the engineering team can get the accurate result in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 4:\n",
    "Variant A and Variant B have a potential and huge advantage to compete with Control Varient, as both their CTR and Time Spent are impressively higher than it. The Control Variant has been failed through comparing with the other two variants, so the new function of these futures are necessary to apply into our existing products/services. In this way, CTR and Time Spent will be improved.\n",
    "Once they apply into our products/services, the real-time monitor and maintainance are necessary to measure their feasibility, so it is essential to arrange related-employees to collect CTR and Time Spent."
